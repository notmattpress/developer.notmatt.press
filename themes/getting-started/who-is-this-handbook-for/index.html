<p>The Theme Developer Handbook is a self-contained resource to help you learn the fundamental principles of creating a WordPress theme. It covers a range of topics that span the basics to advanced development.</p>
<p>You should read this handbook if you want to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a theme based on nothing but your imagination</li>
<li>Build a new theme based on an existing one</li>
<li>Extend another theme by creating a child theme</li>
<li>Understand how themes work </li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of your reasons for starting down this adventure, this handbook will help you take the next steps toward building a WordPress theme of your own.</p>
<h2 class="is-toc-heading wp-block-heading" id="your-skill-level" tabindex="-1"><a href="#your-skill-level">Your skill level</a></h2>
<p>While not a strict requirement, you will get the most out of this handbook if you have a baseline understanding and some experience with web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP. JavaScript knowledge would be a bonus if you plan to add interactivity to the front end.</p>
<p>Present-day WordPress and its block theme system allow you to customize and export a theme directly from the Site Editor interface:</p>

<p>With each major WordPress update, its visual building tools become even more robust. Still, having some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP knowledge will help you move along faster.</p>
<div class="wp-block-wporg-notice is-info-notice"><div class="wp-block-wporg-notice__icon"></div><div class="wp-block-wporg-notice__content"><p>Unlike block themes, <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/themes/classic-themes/">classic themes</a> are built entirely from code. This requires that you be comfortable enough to edit one or more of those languages to some degree.</p></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook/">Reading this handbook</a> page has more information on the prerequisite knowledge you need to build themes.</p>
<p>At the very least, you must be able to set up and configure a website using WordPress. Otherwise, you won’t be able to test or use the theme that you are building. You can learn more about getting things running in the <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/">Tools and setup</a> documentation.</p>
<h2 class="is-toc-heading wp-block-heading" id="what-this-handbook-covers" tabindex="-1"><a href="#what-this-handbook-covers">What this handbook covers</a></h2>
<p>This handbook provides the basic information you need to build both block and classic WordPress themes. This includes in-depth coverage of the essential features and APIs that you should know, such as the topics in the <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/themes/core-concepts/">Core Concepts</a> chapter. It also dives into tools and techniques for building more advanced themes in the <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/themes/advanced-topics/">Advanced Topics</a> chapter.</p>
<p>WordPress is a vast subject. HTML, CSS, PHP, accessibility, and other web technologies are even larger. It’d be impossible to cover every aspect of building a website in this handbook alone. Therefore, it is highly-focused on the fundamentals of theme building.</p>
<p>The goal of this handbook is to give you a solid foundation for WordPress theme creation by providing step-by-step instructions for building basic themes and providing resources to further your skills.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, come along. You’re in for a journey.</p>

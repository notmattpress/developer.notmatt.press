<p>Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code at specific, pre-defined spots. They make up the foundation for how plugins and themes interact with WordPress Core, but theyâ€™re also used extensively by Core itself.</p>
<p>There are two types of hooks: <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/plugins/hooks/actions/">Actions</a> and <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/plugins/hooks/filters/">Filters</a>. To use either, you need to write a custom function known as a <code>Callback</code>, and then register it with a WordPress hook for a specific action or filter.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/plugins/hooks/actions/">Actions</a> allow you to add data or change how WordPress operates. Actions will run at a specific point in the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. Callback functions for Actions can perform some kind of a task, like echoing output to the user or inserting something into the database. Callback functions for an Action do not return anything back to the calling Action hook.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/plugins/hooks/filters/">Filters</a> give you the ability to change data during the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. Callback functions for Filters will accept a variable, modify it, and return it. They are meant to work in an isolated manner, and should never have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a> such as affecting global variables and output. Filters expect to have something returned back to them.</p>
<p>WordPress provides many hooks that you can use, but you can also <a href="https://developer.notmatt.press/plugins/hooks/custom-hooks/">create your own</a> so that other developers can extend and modify your plugin or theme.</p>
<h2 class="is-toc-heading wp-block-heading" id="actions-vs-filters" tabindex="-1"><a href="#actions-vs-filters">Actions vs. Filters</a></h2>
<p>The main difference between an action and a filter can be summed up like this: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>an action takes the info it receives, does something with it, and returns nothing. In other words: it <em>acts</em> on something and then exits, returning nothing back to the calling hook.</li>
<li>a filter takes the info it receives, modifies it somehow, and returns it. In other words: it <em>filters</em> something and passes it back to the hook for further use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Said another way: </p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>an action interrupts the code flow to do something, and then returns back to the normal flow without modifying anything;</li>
<li>a filter is used to modify something in a specific way so that the modification is then used by code later on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>something</em> referred to is the parameter list sent via the hook definition. More on this in later sections.</p>
